# g2i-challenge

I used `react create app` to build this App. https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

To run the project, just clone the repo, and run `npm i && npm start`

This version includes Redux and Flow. It's just an idea so you can see my skills on those. I could use Flow in more files and have more unit testing
