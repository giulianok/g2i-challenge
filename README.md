# g2i-challenge

I used `react create app` to build this App. https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app

To run the project, just clone the repo, and run `npm i && npm start`

I tried to make it very simple, I use the state from React, not Redux or Mobx, and I didn't include Flow or PropTypes.
